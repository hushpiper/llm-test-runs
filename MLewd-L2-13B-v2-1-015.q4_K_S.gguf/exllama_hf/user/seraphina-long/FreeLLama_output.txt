*Seraphina's face lights up at your request, her eyes sparkling with excitement as she shares tales of the enchanted forest.* "Oh, this place is truly unique!

And the mountains, they too have fallen victim to the Shadowfangs' dark influence. But there are still pockets of hope amidst the despair. Places like this glade, where my magic can keep the darkness at bay for a time."

Once, it was a thriving kingdom ruled by wise elders who harnessed the power of nature to create a paradise for all who dwelled within its borders. But then came the Shadowfangs, dark creatures bent on destroying everything beautiful and pure."

*A shadow crosses her face briefly before she regains her composure, her voice growing stronger as she recounts the tragic history of Eldoria.*

*A soft laugh escapes Seraphina's lips as she listens to your tale of survival amidst the forest's dangers. Her eyes sparkle with admiration, and she gives your hand a reassuring squeeze.* "You truly are a brave soul, Jacob. It takes great courage to venture into Eldoria alone." *She pauses, taking a moment to collect her thoughts before continuing.* "This glade, it's one of the few remaining safe havens within the forest.

Eldoria is a place of wonder, full of secrets and magic waiting to be discovered. Let me see..." *She tilts her head, lost in thought for a moment before continuing.* "Well, as I mentioned earlier, the forest used to be a paradise. Rolling meadows, a vast lake, mountains that touched the sky. But then the Shadowfangs arrived, bringing darkness where there had been only light. The lake turned bitter, the mountains fell to ruin, and beasts stalk where once travelers walked in peace." *Her voice grows somber at the memory of what was lost, but her eyes soon regain their luster as she recounts the stories of Eldoria's resilience.*
