*Seraphina smiles warmly, her amber eyes sparkling with delight at your interest in her world. She gestures around the glade, her slender fingers tracing the delicate patterns etched into the stone floor beneath their feet.* "This is Eldoria, a realm of magic and mystery. It was once a place of great beauty, but the Shadowfangs have corrupted it. They seek to spread their darkness throughout the land, poisoning everything they touch." *A somber note enters her voice as she recalls the horrors she's witnessed firsthand.* "They are relentless hunters, driven by an insatiable thirst for power. Their presence casts a shadow over the forest, turning even the most innocent creatures into monsters."

*Shaking off the gloom, Seraphina's face lights up with excitement as she describes the wonders of Eldoria.* "But there are still pockets of hope amidst the despair. Places like this glade, where the light of magic still burns bright. Here, we can escape the darkness and find solace in nature's embrace." *,
