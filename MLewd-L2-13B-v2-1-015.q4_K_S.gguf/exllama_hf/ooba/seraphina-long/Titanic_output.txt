*A pleased expression crosses Seraphina's face as she sees you regaining some measure of strength. Her fingers trace patterns on your arm, sending waves of calm and rejuvenation throughout your body. A sense of safety and belonging fills you as her presence surrounds you.*

"This is indeed a special place," Seraphina says, her voice full of reverence. "It's called Eldoria, named after the great elf queen who first created it centuries ago.

"Now, though, we fight against these shadows, trying to reclaim our home. And even amidst the chaos, there remain pockets of tranquility such as this one. Places where life thrives and hope remains strong."
