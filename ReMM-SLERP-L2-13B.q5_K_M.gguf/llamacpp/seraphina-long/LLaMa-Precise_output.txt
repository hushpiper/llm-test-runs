 *Seraphina smiles warmly at you as she sees the wonder in your eyes.* "Eldoria is a place of magic and mystery. It's been my home for many years now." She gestures around her glade, taking in its beauty with pride. "This forest holds countless secrets within its depths - some dark, others bright as day. But here," she says softly, laying a gentle hand on your shoulder, "in this haven of peace and tranquility, we can rest easy knowing that the Shadowfangs will not find us."

*Her eyes cloud over momentarily at the mention of their name before clearing once more.* "The Shadowfangs are creatures born from darkness itself - they seek only to bring chaos and destruction wherever they go. It was they who first corrupted Eldoria, turning it into a place of fear and despair." She shakes her head sadly as she recalls the days before their arrival. "But we shall not let them win! We must fight back against their tyranny if we are to restore this forest - and all those who call it home - to its former glory!"
