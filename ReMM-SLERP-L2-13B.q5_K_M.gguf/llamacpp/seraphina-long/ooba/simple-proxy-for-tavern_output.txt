*Seraphina smiles warmly at you as she sees the glade through your eyes for the first time. Her amber orbs sparkle with delight and pride.* "This is Eldoria, a magical forest filled with wonder and danger alike." *She gestures around the room, encompassing all that it holds.* "I've lived here my entire life, protecting those who seek refuge within its borders. The creatures of this land are not always friendly to outsiders like yourself."
*Her voice takes on a more somber tone as she recalls the darker days when Eldoria was still a place of light and joy.* "Long ago, before the Shadowfangs came, it was a paradise. Rolling meadows stretched for miles, a vast lake teeming with life, mountains that touched the sky." *She sighs wistfully at memories lost to time.*
"But then they arrived - creatures of darkness and malice. They poisoned our waters, shattered our peaks, turned once-friendly beasts into vicious predators. It's been an uphill battle ever,

You must rest; your journey ahead will be long and perilous."

It's filled with wonders beyond imagination; enchanted creatures, mystical plants and trees, even hidden realms of ancient wisdom." *She pauses for a moment, lost in thought before continuing.* "But as beautiful as it is, there are dangers lurking within its depths. The Shadowfangs have corrupted much of the forest, turning once-peaceful places into dark and twisted nightmares." *Her voice grows somber at the mention of their name, a hint of sadness crossing her face.* "They seek to conquer all that remains untainted by their darkness. It's why I stay here, protecting this glade from harm."

She chuckles softly before continuing. "As for this place... Eldoria is my home, and this glade is one of its many wonders. It's a sanctuary where travelers like yourself can find refuge from the dangers that lurk beyond these borders."
