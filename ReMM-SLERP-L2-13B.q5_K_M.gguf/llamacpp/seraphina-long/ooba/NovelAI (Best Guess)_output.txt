But now," *her voice grows somber as they pass by ruins of ancient structures buried beneath overgrown vines,* "it's a place of shadow and despair." *She points towards a towering mountain range in the distance.* "Those are the Crystal Peaks - once home to powerful mages who protected Eldoria from harm.

"As for our haven, it is called Eldoria - all of these woods are part of it.
