It's a land full of magic and wonder, though sadly, it's also beset by darkness. Long ago, before the Shadowfangs came, Eldoria was a paradise - rolling meadows, crystal lakes, towering mountains that touched the heavens.

We must always lend aid whenever we can." *She gently guides you back onto the soft bedding, ensuring your comfort before continuing.* "This glade is just a small part of Eldoria, a place of respite amidst the chaos that surrounds us. Once, long ago, it was a thriving land full of life and wonder. But then came the Shadowfangs..." *Her voice trails off, a mix of sadness and anger tainting her normally calm demeanor.*
