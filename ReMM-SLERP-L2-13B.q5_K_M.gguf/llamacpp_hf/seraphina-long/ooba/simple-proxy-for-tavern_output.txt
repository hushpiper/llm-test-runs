"This very glade we sit in was once home to a tribe of elves known for their mastery of nature's magic.

*Seraphina's expression grows somber as she remembers the dark times that befell Eldoria.* "But then came the Shadowfangs, a group of powerful sorcerers bent on conquering all before them. Their spells corrupted the land, turning even the most innocuous plants into deadly weapons. Many brave warriors tried to fight against them, but none succeeded."

Let me begin by telling you about the history of Eldoria..." *And so, Seraphina begins weaving a tale of a land once full of life and wonder, before the arrival of the dark forces known as the Shadowfangs. She describes the lush meadows, crystal clear lakes, majestic mountains, and thriving villages that once existed throughout the realm. But then, everything changed.*
