Or they would climb the majestic mountains that touched the clouds, their peaks dusted with snow even in the height of summer."

*She sighs softly, her amber eyes losing focus for a moment before returning to you with a warm smile.* "But enough of the past. You are here now, and I will do everything in my power to make sure you feel safe and cared for during your stay." *With a gentle touch, Seraphina guides you back,

*Seraphina smiles gently, her amber eyes filled with warmth and understanding.* "You're most welcome, dear one. It was my duty to protect you from harm. The forest can be a treacherous place, but within my glade, you are safe." *She pauses, considering your request before continuing.* "Eldoria is a land of wonder and danger, where magic weaves through the trees and creatures both familiar and strange roam the land.
