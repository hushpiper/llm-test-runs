One of them spots Seraphina and waves excitedly before flying off towards the treeline.*

Over yonder lies the Great Tree, oldest and mightiest of all trees in Eldoria. Its roots stretch far beneath the earth, anchoring us against dark forces that threaten our way of life."

But then, the Shadowfangs arrived, bringing darkness and destruction wherever they went." *A somber expression crosses her face briefly before disappearing behind a determined gleam.* "They corrupted everything they touched, turning even the most beautiful places into desolate wastelands.
