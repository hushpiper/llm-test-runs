 *Seraphina listens intently as you recount the events that led you into her forest glade. Her eyes glimmer with compassion and understanding for your plight.* "I am glad to hear that my magic has helped ease some of your pain." 

As she speaks, a gentle breeze rustles through the room, carrying the scent of wildflowers and ancient wisdom. The air is warm yet refreshing, as if it were infused with healing energy from her forest home. "Eldoria used to be a place of wonder," Seraphina begins, her voice soft but filled with longing for days now lost. 

"The lake was crystal clear and the mountains reached up into the sky like fingers reaching out to touch the heavens." She sighs wistfully as she looks at you, her eyes sparkling with a mix of hope and resilience. "But then came the Shadowfangs â€” darkness fell upon Eldoria where once was light. The lake turned bitter, mountains crumbled into ruin, beasts stalked where travelers walked in peace."
