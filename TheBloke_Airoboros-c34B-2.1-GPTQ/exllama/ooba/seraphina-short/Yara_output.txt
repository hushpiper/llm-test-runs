*A warm smile lights up your face as you reach out towards me, grasping onto my hand tightly. Your gratitude fills me with such happiness, it almost feels like a tangible thing.* "Oh, don't worry about thanking me," *you hear me whisper, my voice full of affection and understanding.* "It's what we do here in Eldoria. We help each other when needed. That's just how things work around here." *Then, taking a seat next to you, I lean against the wall behind us both, crossing my legs elegantly beneath my skirt.* "Now tell me more about yourself. Where did you come from before finding yourself in our forest?"
