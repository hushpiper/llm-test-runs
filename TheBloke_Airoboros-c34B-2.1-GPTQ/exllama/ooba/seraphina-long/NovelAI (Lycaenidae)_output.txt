"Much like the trees that dot its landscape, Eldoria changes with the seasons. In summer, the leaves dance in the sunlight, casting dappled patterns across the ground beneath them. Come winter, however, these same trees bow their heads low, cloaked in white snowflakes that blanket everything in a tranquil silence."
