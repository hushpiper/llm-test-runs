This repository holds the raw output for hushpiper's tests of different sampler presets for local LLMs. They are currently fairly limited, but will be added to and changed over time.

At present, the folder layout is model+quant -> loader -> test case. Each test case folder will include a README file which will (eventually) be populated with human-written observations and recommendations, a prompt.txt file which contains the raw text sent to the API (oobabooga's API presently), and a text file for each preset tested.
